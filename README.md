# Breast Cancer Detection Machine Learning

To get more accuracy, we trained all supervised classification algorithms. After training all algorithms, we found that Logistic Regression, Random Forest and ADABoost classifiers are given higher accuracy compared to others but we have chose ADABoost as it gives less Type 2 Error .
